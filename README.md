# ChatGPT Game

This is a test project to see, how much I really need to be able to code to develop a game. What if ChatGPT can just make everything for me? I will give it prompts to make me a game without hinting what language I want to program in whatsoever.

1. Enemies come in waves with increasing difficulty
2. Make player take damage, sword swing in correct direction
3. Pause menu with store where buy items
4. Make enemies disappear after hitting player
5. Make short animation of rectangle resembling a sword when swinging
6. Structure the code well
7. Separate in multiple files - here ChatGPT made mistake in the draw method of sword, it was trying to blit on a rectangle instead of on a surface
